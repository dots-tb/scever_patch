# scever_patch
Patches the sce_version and sce_param of a PS4 Elf

    usage:  scever_patch module<.elf/.prx> <05008001>

NOTE: THIS MUST BE A DECRYPTED ELF! 

## Why does this exist if it doesn't work on Encrypted games?
It can be used to run newer version of GM Studio, Unity engine, or normal SDK compiled elf that require a newer SDK to run.
